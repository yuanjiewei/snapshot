# Snapshot Helm Chart

> Experimental feature. The agent runs as a privileged DaemonSet to perform
> CRIU checkpoint and restore operations.

This chart installs the snapshot infrastructure:

- the operator Deployment that reconciles `SnapshotJob`, `PodSnapshot`, and
  `PodSnapshotContent`
- the agent DaemonSet on eligible GPU nodes
- `snapshot-pvc`, or wiring to an existing PVC
- cluster-scoped agent and operator RBAC
- the seccomp profile CRIU needs

Install one Snapshot release for the cluster. Every node agent mounts the same
shared checkpoint PVC directly and watches checkpoint/restore pods in all
namespaces. Workload pods never mount checkpoint storage.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with x86_64 GPU nodes
- NVIDIA driver 580.xx or newer
- **containerd** or **CRI-O** (chart defaults to containerd; see below for CRI-O / OpenShift)
- a cluster where a privileged DaemonSet with `hostPID`, `hostIPC`, and `hostNetwork` is acceptable

The checkpoint PVC must support `ReadWriteMany` because agents on multiple nodes
mount it concurrently. Chart-created claims always request `ReadWriteMany` and
are retained when the Helm release is removed.

An existing `ReadWriteOnce` claim cannot be upgraded in place because PVC access
modes are immutable. When `storage.pvc.create=false`, the chart assumes the named
existing claim supports `ReadWriteMany`; verify its access mode before installing
or upgrading. To migrate, create a new RWX claim, copy the retained checkpoint
data once if it must be preserved, then set `storage.pvc.create=false` and
`storage.pvc.name` to the new claim. The old retained claim remains untouched.

## CRI-O and OpenShift

For CRI-O nodes set `runtime.type=crio`. Only set `runtime.socketPath` if the CRI
socket is not the default for that type (see `values.yaml`). On OpenShift, set
`openshift.enabled=true` so the chart emits the extra RBAC and pod annotations
the agent needs. Example:

```bash
helm upgrade --install snapshot ./charts/snapshot \
  --namespace "${NAMESPACE}" --create-namespace \
  --set storage.pvc.create=true \
  --set runtime.type=crio \
  --set openshift.enabled=true
```

## Minimal install

Create the checkpoint PVC and the agent:

```bash
helm upgrade --install snapshot ./charts/snapshot \
  --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
  --create-namespace \
  --set storage.pvc.create=true
```

If your cluster does not use a default storage class, also set
`storage.pvc.storageClass`.

Reuse an existing PVC instead:

```bash
helm upgrade --install snapshot ./charts/snapshot \
  --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
  --create-namespace \
  --set storage.pvc.create=false \
  --set storage.pvc.name=my-snapshot-pvc
```

## CRD upgrades

Helm creates the CRDs in [crds/](./crds) on a fresh install and then leaves them
alone: `helm upgrade` never updates them. To close that gap the operator
Deployment runs a `crd-installer` init container before the manager starts. It
server-side applies the CRDs embedded in the `api` module — the same manifests
`make generate` mirrors into `crds/` — so every rollout converges the cluster on
definitions the running binary agrees with. Nothing to update means nothing is
written:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/snapshot-operator -n ${NAMESPACE} -c crd-installer
```

```text
Applied CRD  {"name": "podsnapshots.nvidia.com", "action": "unchanged"}
Applied CRD  {"name": "podsnapshotcontents.nvidia.com", "action": "unchanged"}
Applied CRD  {"name": "snapshotjobs.nvidia.com", "action": "unchanged"}
CRDs already up to date, no changes applied  {"count": 3}
```

The installer runs whenever the operator pod is recreated, which a `helm upgrade`
does as soon as the image tag moves — `image.operator.tag` defaults to the
chart's `appVersion`, so a release that changes the CRDs changes the tag too. If
you pin a mutable tag such as `latest`, rebuilding it does not change the pod
spec and nothing rolls; restart the Deployment yourself to pick up new
definitions.

`rbac.create=true` grants the operator ServiceAccount `get`/`patch` on the three
CRDs in [crds/](./crds) by name, plus an unscoped `create` — RBAC cannot match
`resourceNames` on create, so that verb only ever lets the operator add a CRD,
never modify one it does not own.

Set `crdUpgrade.enabled=false` when CRDs are managed out of band, for example by
GitOps or by a cluster admin who does not want the operator holding
`apiextensions` permissions. That drops the init container and the extra RBAC —
and makes updating the CRDs your responsibility after every chart upgrade:

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f ./charts/snapshot/crds/
```

## Verify

```bash
PVC_NAME="${PVC_NAME:-snapshot-pvc}" # match storage.pvc.name
kubectl get pvc "${PVC_NAME}" -n "${NAMESPACE}"
kubectl rollout status daemonset/snapshot-agent -n ${NAMESPACE}
kubectl get pods -n ${NAMESPACE} -l app.kubernetes.io/name=snapshot -o wide
```

Reserved `s3` and `oci` values remain chart-owned placeholders for future
snapshot backends, but only `pvc` is implemented today.

CustomStorage is opt-in for new checkpoints. Set
`config.cudaCheckpoint.storageMode=posix` only on nodes whose helper advertises
the CUDA 13.4 CustomStorage completion API and the Snapshot-local POSIX adapter.
Snapshot rejects the checkpoint before locking the target when the requested
capability is unavailable; it does not silently produce a legacy artifact.
The first rollout is limited to one GPU (TP1). A container may have multiple
CUDA-owning processes in that GPU's process tree. Checkpoint creation and
restore reject larger POSIX topologies before CUDA or
CRIU mutation. Four 64 MiB transfer slots are the qualified TP1 setting.
Changing the value back to `legacy` affects new checkpoints only. Restore uses
the storage mode recorded in each checkpoint manifest so already published
POSIX checkpoints remain restorable.

The CUDA helper sidecar is mandatory for CUDA-bearing `legacy` and `posix`
operations in this release, but the agent controller starts independently so
CPU-only checkpoint/restore remains available if the helper is unhealthy.
Before a CUDA-bearing operation mutates its target, Snapshot waits for helper
health and the capabilities required by the selected storage mode. This
prevents a systemic helper or driver failure from being mistaken for a
negative CUDA process probe and producing a CRIU-only checkpoint for a GPU
workload. Deploy the agent and sidecar together; changing the ConfigMap rolls
the DaemonSet pods.
Before a planned agent upgrade or restart, drain every live target that has
completed a CustomStorage checkpoint or restore on that helper. Unexpected
helper restart while such a target remains live is not qualified in V1.

V1 serializes CUDA checkpoint and restore sequences within one agent pod. A
sequence may cover multiple CUDA-owning PIDs from one workload, but another
workload handled by that agent waits until the active sequence completes. Run
at most one Snapshot agent installation on a node: separate DaemonSets are not
coordinated and can issue overlapping CUDA operations. Host-scoped coordination
and per-GPU concurrency are follow-ups.

POSIX manifests require a reader that understands `cudaRestore.storageMode`.
Do not roll the agent back to a release predating that field while any POSIX
artifacts remain eligible for restore. Disable new POSIX creation, retire or
migrate those artifacts according to their retention policy, and only then
roll back. Legacy manifests from older releases remain readable.

`transferBufferCount * transferChunkBytes` must not exceed 1 GiB
(1073741824 bytes) of pinned memory per CUDA device. Increase the CUDA helper's
memory limit when increasing either transfer setting or the number of GPUs used
by one operation.

See [values.yaml](./values.yaml) for the full configuration surface.

## Uninstall

```bash
helm uninstall snapshot -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

The chart does not delete checkpoint data automatically. Remove the PVC yourself
if you want to clear stored checkpoints:

```bash
PVC_NAME="${PVC_NAME:-snapshot-pvc}" # match storage.pvc.name
kubectl delete pvc "${PVC_NAME}" -n "${NAMESPACE}"
```
